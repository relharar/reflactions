When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
when i will work on a shered project with multiple contributers

why might yuo want to alwaways pull changes manually rether having Git automaticly stay up to date with yure remote reposetory ?
so yo can change and decide on the commits youd like to share .
