When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
when i will work on a shered project with multiple contributers

why might yuo want to alwaways pull changes manually rether having Git automaticly stay up to date with yure remote reposetory ?
so yo can change and decide on the commits youd like to share .

describe the diffrences between forks, clone, and branches. when would you use one istead of another?
forks are made on github and it is making a copy of another github repositories to your account like that you can maintain your version of the project.
clones is makng a copy of a repositorie local or remote to your local computer we will use it when we will want wo work on a project localy.
braches are made on a local repositorie to allow us to work on changes out side the existing branch.

what is the benfit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally ?
we can go thtogh the diff offline 

How would you collaborate without |Git or Github? whet would be easyer , and what would be harder.
i would snd the changes that i wand to the persson i colabarationg with and one will be in charge of commiting to master, it is eazyer to collaborate using github
